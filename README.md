# Drone_Flight_Path_Simulator

Our project aims to design, implement, and test a 3D visualization architecture that allows operators in small military units to plan, visualize, and revise drone flight paths over a specific terrain to fulfill the mission success criteria of effectively utilizing sensors over an area while minimizing detection, and possibly susceptibility to countermeasures.
