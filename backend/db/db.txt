This text file contains the information needed to get the db running on your machine.

Step 1
- Install PostgreSQL https://www.postgresql.org/download/

Step 2 
- PostgreSQL will prompt you to set a password, this password will also be used in pgAdmin4

Step 3 
- Install pgAdmin4 (GUI app that helps with managing the db) https://www.pgadmin.org/download/

Step 4 
- Once these two are downloaded start up pgAdmin4 and you will see on the left handside Servers
- Right click on servers and choose Register -> Server\
- Name the server
- Click on the connection tab and put localhost in hostname/address
- You can leave port and username as the defaults
- Where it says password enter the password you set earlier when installing PostgreSQL
- It is recommended the whole team sets the same password so no code needs to be altered
when different people run it on their own machines 
- So everyone should have the same info username: postgres and pw: csula
- Once the server is created, right click on the server (should have an elephant head)
- Choose Create -> Database
- Name it SUAS Flight Path Visualizer, then click Save

Step 5 
- Once the db is created
